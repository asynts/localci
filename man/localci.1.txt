LOCALCI(1)                       User Commands                      LOCALCI(1)

NAME
       localci - Build a range of commits

SYNOPSIS
       localci [--help] [--version] [--] commit ...

DESCRIPTION
       Checks  out  all  provided  commits and runs the build command.  If all
       builds are successful, switches back to the originally checked out  re‐
       vision.   Otherwise,  stops  at the first unsuccessful build and leaves
       the repository in a detached state.

       The commits are directly passed to  git rev-list so  ranges  like  mas‐
       ter..HEAD are allowed.

OPTIONS
       --help
              Output help information and exit.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       localci master..HEAD

       localci 55c486637 foo..bar
